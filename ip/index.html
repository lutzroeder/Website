Intentional Programming (IP) was a research project at Microsoft until spring 2001.
In IP source code is stored in a hierarchical database were each node is an instance of a programming language construct.
Programs can be edited using a structured editor with full graphics layout capabilities. 
An extensible compiler architecture enables the introduction of new user-defined keywords as well
as representing traditional languages like C++ and Java.

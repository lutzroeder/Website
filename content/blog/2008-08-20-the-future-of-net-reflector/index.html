<p>After more than eight years of working on .NET Reflector, I have decided it is time to move on and explore some new opportunities.</p>

<p>I have reached an agreement to have <a href="http://reflector.red-gate.com/" target="_blank">Red Gate Software</a> continue the development of .NET <a href="http://reflector.red-gate.com/" target="_blank"></a>Reflector.
Red Gate has a lot of experience creating tools for both .NET and SQL Server. 
They have the resources necessary to work on new features, and Reflector fits nicely with other .NET tools the company offers.</p>

<p>Red Gate will continue to provide the free community version and is looking for your feedback and ideas for future versions.</p>
